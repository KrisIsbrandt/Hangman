# HangmanMotorola
Console application to play hangman game. 

This is my first c# application, which was very fun to make and I enjoyed every step. 
Just a few words about myself and why I code. Since I was a kid I enjoyed playing around computers. 
However, my education path led me to a different area of specialization, mainly finance and economics. 
To be honest, I did not find work in finance so exciting, and thus I tried to switch my career path towards IT.
I enjoy programming as it gives me satisfaction after implementing a new app or learning new technology.
There is a lot to learn and it is hard to get bored.
